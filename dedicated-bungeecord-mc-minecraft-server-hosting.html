           <h3 class="subheading">Minecraft bungeeCord is a popular and high-power online game application. The game is developed using the programming language java. In Minecraft bungeeCord, players create and break apart various kinds of blocks in three-dimensional worlds. The game’s two main modes are Survival and Creative. In Survival, players must find their own building supplies and food. They also interact with blocklike mobs, or moving creatures. (Creepers and zombies are some of the dangerous ones.) In Creative, players are given supplies and do not have to eat to survive. They also can break all kinds of blocks immediately. This can be played by a single player or even number of players can participate in the same Minecraft bungeeCord World depending upon the slots purchased. but at Dedicated Minecraft bungeeCord Host you won't have to worry about slots. We offer dedicated server resources for our game servers<br>With prices starting from $12/mo. <br>Want to test drive our Dedicated Servers? <b class="c-pink">  We have 2 Day Free Trial</b><br>

              <h2>Why dedicated servers for Minecraft bungeeCord?</h2>
              <p>For better gaming experience and allowance to grow the online community of Minecraft bungeeCord players it would be suggestible to take Minecraft bungeeCord free through dedicated servers. Thus thee aspirants would not need to share the Java Virtual Machine where the game actually runs and the Central Processing Unit that carries our complex Minecraft bungeeCord calculations. If the Central Processing Unit would be shared by many users at the same time, it definitely hampers the performance. As there would be too much of load on the CPU it starts lagging and thus the response of the system would not be that prompt as expected by the users.</p>

          <h3>Where Dedicated Minecraft bungeeCord Server will be efficient</h3><br>
          <p> The best Minecraft bungeeCord servers would occupy the entire Minecraft bungeeCord environment. In case of shared environment when many clients would be using the server at the same time, other clients would have chances of falling prey to Distributed Denial of Service attacks. When the shared servers would be flooded with traffic, it would hamper the performance. This may lead to improper speeds and lagging responses. Therefore dedicated servers would be much efficient than shared environments.
Dedicated severs allow the users to allocate the amount of Random Access memory and Central Processing Unit required to run the Minecraft bungeeCord environment effectively and efficiently. The resources would not be shared among the servers and thus Minecraft bungeeCord for free through dedicated servers would provide better performance as per the expectations of the clients. Even when someone else’s server gets huge amount of traffic and the system may start lagging; it would not affect the Minecraft bungeeCord environment of the client.</p>

              <p>First you need to know Minecraft bungeeCord utilizes two CPU threads. One is the main game thread and the other is the networking thread. A thread can use about 100% CPU. We advise people start out with the 100% CPU Deal..</p>

          <h3>Main Game Thread</h3><br>
          <p> This thread does most of the core stuff in the game, including handling all the addons. This will normally be working the hardest of the two. It's common for this thread to be sitting at around ~60% CPU on busy servers.</p>

          <h3>Networking Thread</h3><br>
          <p>The networking thread normally uses up about ~15% on a busy server, but if you leverage it correctly it will work pretty hard. To really take advantage of this thread you need a map properly setup with area portals (PVS).</p>

	How To Install MetaMod &amp; Plugins on A Minecraft bungeeCord  Server
</h2>
<p data-selectable-paragraph="">
	Renting Minecraft bungeeCord  servers are one of the best entertainment long time Counter-Strike fans go to these days. The reason is simple: It is incredible. However, if one is hosting a private server, there are some few bits and pieces that have to be installed. For the server to stand out and to run without complications.
</p>
<p data-selectable-paragraph="">
	Of course, we are talking about&nbsp;
	<strong>
		Modding
	</strong>
	. When it comes to Minecraft bungeeCord  servers and the half-life engine, there are to Plugins that are necessary for the best results. Let us discuss how to install the MetaMod and Plugins for the Dedicated Minecraft bungeeCord  servers.
</p>
<h2 data-selectable-paragraph="">
	How to install MetaMod:
</h2>
<p data-selectable-paragraph="">
	MetaMod is an vital mod plugin, and it is built with and for the half-life engine. Since it is a very dynamic tool, it allows the half-Life engine to run with mod addons and plugins. Initially, it is essential if a player wants to mod their Minecraft bungeeCord server in any way. Follow the instructions to install the MetaMod on the Minecraft bungeeCord servers.
</p>
<ol>
	<li data-selectable-paragraph="">
		<strong>
			Extract and store the Files
		</strong>
		: The files will be downloaded as a &mdash; zip file. Extract the data onto a folder and save it to the desktop. The file should contain an &ldquo;addon&rdquo; folder.
	</li>
	<li data-selectable-paragraph="">
		<strong>
			Locate the server directory
		</strong>
		: The Server directory is the location where the addons will be stored. In the case of a private server, use an FTP client to run and open the server directory. Otherwise, simply go to the Server Directory from the Local discs. After that simply drag the folder into the main Minecraft bungeeCord  directory.
	</li>
	<li data-selectable-paragraph="">
		<strong>
			The next step is simple: Generate a VDF file for Minecraft bungeeCord
		</strong>
		&nbsp;using the Link&nbsp;
		<a href="http://www.sourcemm.net/?go=vdf." rel="noopener nofollow">
			http://www.sourcemm.net/?go=vdf.
		</a>
		&nbsp;The method is rather simple. Just select Game and click on &ldquo;
		<em>
			generate metaMod.VDF&rdquo;&nbsp;
		</em>
		option and the file should be downloaded automatically.
	</li>
	<li data-selectable-paragraph="">
		Before proceeding, check the file. Run it with Word pad or Notepad and see if the text is correct:
	</li>
</ol>
<p data-selectable-paragraph="">
	<em>
		&ldquo;File&rdquo; &ldquo;../Minecraft bungeeCord /addons/
	</em>
	metamod
	<em>
		/bin/server&rdquo;
	</em>
</p>
<h2 data-selectable-paragraph="">
	Install the Plugins:
</h2>
<p data-selectable-paragraph="">
	Now that the MetaMod has been taken care of, the Minecraft bungeeCord servers should be able to run the Plugins. This will allow the server to be more versatile and install more mods and plugins. Of course, first, the player will need the Plugins files.
</p>
<p data-selectable-paragraph="">
	They are useful in several ways, starting from better accessibility and permissions. Furthermore, it provides a better user-friendly navigation menu for the server hosts. In any case, if the server host wants to install additional mods and plugins, then Plugins becomes a mandatory download for any Counterstrike fans.
</p>
<ol>
	<li data-selectable-paragraph="">
		Download the Plugins latest version. The files should be available for all platforms at&nbsp;
		<a href="https://www.Plugins.net/" rel="noopener nofollow">
			Plugins.net
		</a>
	</li>
	<li data-selectable-paragraph="">
		The data will again be downloaded as a .zip file which would contain cfg and addon files. Simply extract the data
	</li>
	<li data-selectable-paragraph="">
		Use the FTP client to navigate into the server directory or manually go through the Local Disc Directories.
	</li>
	<li data-selectable-paragraph="">
		Finally, move the mid folder into the Minecraft bungeeCord  Server Directory. The Addons folder will now have three files. Metamod.vdf that was copied earlier, Plugins and MetaMod sub-folders.
	</li>
	<li data-selectable-paragraph="">
		Now we edit the .ini file of Metamod to be able to run Plugins. The data should be present in the Metamod folder, find the .ini file and open it with a text editor. Scroll down and add lines &ldquo;addons/Plugins/bins/Plugins_mm&rdquo; at the bottom of the document.
	</li>
	<li data-selectable-paragraph="">
		After that, simply restart the server and Plugins should be running.
	</li>
</ol>
<h2 data-selectable-paragraph="">
	Errors and fixes:
</h2>
<p data-selectable-paragraph="">
	If the instruction is followed, there should be no errors. However, if there is, chances are the files were not downloaded correctly, or some steps were overlooked. To avoid that situation, make sure to:
</p>
<ul>
	<li data-selectable-paragraph="">
		Download compatible versions of both the mod files
	</li>
	<li data-selectable-paragraph="">
		Make sure there is no corrupted or missing data
	</li>
	<li data-selectable-paragraph="">
		Do not skip the .vdf file creation and don&rsquo;t make any tampers with the script
	</li>
	<li data-selectable-paragraph="">
		Do not change anything else in the metamod.ini file while the .vdf is being edited in.
	</li>
</ul>
<p data-selectable-paragraph="">
	If the files are still not running, causing crashes or freezes in the server, reinstalling will solve the process. Just make sure to clean the slate before doing so. If you&rsquo;re still running into issues with your Minecraft bungeeCord  server hosting, contact us and we&rsquo;ll help you out as soon as possible.

                                <p>This the sole point of getting a Dedicated Minecraft bungeeCord  server in the first place. 7 Days to Die can be hard and frustrating! Or what else do you expect it's a post-apocalyptic survival game.  Therefore if you are a new 7D2D player you have to play the single-player and get the hang of it first before considering the multiplayer mode and renting a server. You get the hang of how to build a decent base, explore the map, and pick up some survival, crafting, and hunting strategies. </p>

So playing on a public server means you have no control of your stuff when you are offline. people can delete trash or even stealing your lot. so this factors in the need for renting a private Dedicated Minecraft bungeeCord  server which you can share with friends and monitor who has access to what by setting rules and permissions.</p>

                                <p>Plain vanilla 7d2d can be boring. You would need a server hosting provider that will let you add mods to your server.

                                <p>Not all game servers support mods! If you don’t want to restrict your server to Vanilla Dedicated Minecraft bungeeCord  in the future, or you know you want to create a modded Dedicated Minecraft bungeeCord  server, then you need to check that your potential server host supports mod installation.&nbsp;</p>
                                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                                <p>Some server control panels offer a one-click mod install system. If you’re sure you want the freedom of adding mods then this is the easiest option. You will be able to install addons from their built-in mod manager or take advantage of the range of mods available through the Steam Workshop. This generally means less messing around with the control panel and more game time. Some game server hosts support mods but you need to use FTP to install the mods yourself. Other companies offer a drop-down menu with a limited number of the most popular mods, like Starvation, Darkness Falls, and War of the Walkers. The ability to add mods sometimes comes at an extra cost.</p>

                                <p>this is the time it takes to transmit a small data set from your computer to the server and back to your computer. Normally measured in milliseconds. The ping time is a very important indicator for online games. Therefore the location of the gaming servers plays a critical role in the fluidity of your gameplay. Lower pings means that yourDedicated Minecraft bungeeCord  game will be smooth.</p>

                                <p>This is an important factor when it comes to choosing your game server control panel. Most gaming server companies use the TCadmin or multicraft panels which are not customized. At Xgamingserver we've based our 7Global Offensive (Minecraft bungeeCord) game control panel on the Pterodactyl panel.</p>
                                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                                <p>Which the developers prioritize security, and the control panel includes password hashing, two-factor authentication, and HTTPS as standard. One of the most interesting design and security decisions made by the developers is Docker support. All game servers run in Docker containers, providing excellent control over resources, improved security, and environments tailored to the needs of each game.</p>

                                <p>The online gaming and e-sports sector is one of the main targets of DDoS attacks. As a result, it is essential for hosting platforms to be permanently protected against these frequent, massive threats. So when choosing your game hosting provider for Global Offensive (Minecraft bungeeCord), It is important to ensure that their servers are protected for DDos attacks. At xgamingserver, all our servers are DDOS protected so you don't have to worry about that.</p>

At some point, you're guaranteed to need to contact them with an issue of some kind. Before you sign up with them, it helps to know how responsive they are to customer inquiries. Check their website for contact options to make sure there is a contact method that suits you. In addition to the usual ticket system, do they offer chat services or email support? Maybe they have a Discord server you can join? You could even try contacting them to ask a few questions and judge their professionalism and response time before signing up.</p>

                                <p>If you’re new to game server hosting, or you're not sure your potential host offers the services you need, it might be worthwhile asking them if they'll create a test server for you to trial. Hosts won't always advertise the possibility of a trial, but if you contact them you might be surprised by their willingness to provide a test service. If a trial isn't possible, you need to be clear on their refund policy (often called “money back guarantee”). </p>
