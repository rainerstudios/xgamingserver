            <p>The networking thread normally uses up about ~15% on a busy server, but if you leverage it correctly it will work pretty hard. To really take advantage of this thread you need a map properly setup with area portals (PVS).</p>

                              <p>Zombie games never go out of fashion. And 7D2D is one of them. 7 Days to Die events happen during aftermath of a nuclear&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_World_War" rel="noreferrer noopener">Third World War</a>&nbsp;that destroyed an extremely large part of the world, except for some areas such as the fictional county of Navezgane,&nbsp;Arizona. The player is a survivor of the war who must survive by finding shelter, food, and water, as well as scavenging supplies to fend off the numerous&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie" rel="noreferrer noopener">zombies</a>. Though there is no real objective except surviving at this moment.</p>

                              <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                              <p>That's precisely what the game is about surviving.<br></p>
                              <p>Below are some of the factors to consider before renting a RageMP server host.</p>
                              <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                              <h2>RageMP is a Multiplayer Game</h2>
                              <!-- /wp:heading -->

                              <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                              <p>This the sole point of getting a RageMP server in the first place. 7 Days to Die can be hard and frustrating! Or what else do you expect it's a post-apocalyptic survival game.  Therefore if you are a new 7D2D player you have to play the single-player and get the hang of it first before considering the multiplayer mode and renting a server. You get the hang of how to build a decent base, explore the map, and pick up some survival, crafting, and hunting strategies. </p>
                              <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                              <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                              <p>you'd need to figure out the best tricks to use in order to survive. So that in case you playing with friends you won't be the laughing stock all the time.</p>

                              <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                              <p>But once you’ve survived your first few challenges and you’ve got some good building ideas, multiplayer makes 7 Days to Die a lot more fun! So playing on a public server means you have no control of your stuff when you are offline. people can delete trash or even stealing your lot. so this factors in the need for renting a private RageMP server which you can share with friends and monitor who has access to what by setting rules and permissions.</p>

                              <p>Not all game servers support mods! If you don’t want to restrict your server to Vanilla RageMP in the future, or you know you want to create a modded RageMP server, then you need to check that your potential server host supports mod installation.&nbsp;</p>

                              <p>Some server control panels offer a one-click mod install system. If you’re sure you want the freedom of adding mods then this is the easiest option. You will be able to install addons from their built-in mod manager or take advantage of the range of mods available through the Steam Workshop. This generally means less messing around with the control panel and more game time. Some game server hosts support mods but you need to use FTP to install the mods yourself. Other companies offer a drop-down menu with a limited number of the most popular mods, like Starvation, Darkness Falls, and War of the Walkers. The ability to add mods sometimes comes at an extra cost.</p>

                              <p>this is the time it takes to transmit a small data set from your computer to the server and back to your computer. Normally measured in milliseconds. The ping time is a very important indicator for online games. Therefore the location of the gaming servers plays a critical role in the fluidity of your gameplay. Lower pings means that yourRageMP game will be smooth.</p>

                              <p> RageMP&nbsp;servers can run on consoles, PC, and Linux. &nbsp;At the moment console server gaming for 7dtd is limited so for the best experience we advise using PC gaming.  Which supports both multiplayer: Survival (both randomly generated and standard) and Creative modes.</p>

                              <p>This is an important factor when it comes to choosing your game server control panel. Most gaming server companies use the TCadmin or multicraft panels which are not customized. At Xgamingserver we've based our 7RageMP game control panel on the Pterodactyl panel.</p>
                              <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                              <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                              <p>Which the developers prioritize security, and the control panel includes password hashing, two-factor authentication, and HTTPS as standard. One of the most interesting design and security decisions made by the developers is Docker support. All game servers run in Docker containers, providing excellent control over resources, improved security, and environments tailored to the needs of each game.</p>

                              <p>The online gaming and e-sports sector is one of the main targets of DDoS attacks. As a result, it is essential for hosting platforms to be permanently protected against these frequent, massive threats. So when choosing your game hosting provider for RageMP, It is important to ensure that their servers are protected for DDos attacks. At xgamingserver, all our servers are DDOS protected so you don't have to worry about that.</p>

Before you sign up with them, it helps to know how responsive they are to customer inquiries. Check their website for contact options to make sure there is a contact method that suits you. In addition to the usual ticket system, do they offer chat services or email support? Maybe they have a Discord server you can join? You could even try contacting them to ask a few questions and judge their professionalism and response time before signing up.</p>

Hosts won't always advertise the possibility of a trial, but if you contact them you might be surprised by their willingness to provide a test service. If a trial isn't possible, you need to be clear on their refund policy (often called “money back guarantee”). </p>

          <h3>What&rsquo;s RageMP and How Does it&nbsp;Work?</h3>
<p>Can&rsquo;t get enough of<a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/V/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://www.rockstargames.com/V/"> GTA V</a>? Well, we can&rsquo;t blame you. After all, <strong>Grand Theft Auto V is one of the most successful games</strong> of the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto#Main_series" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto#Main_series"> GTA series</a>. Ever since its inception back in 2013, the game has sold over 90 million copies making bewildering revenue of about $6 billion. So, yes, it&rsquo;s safe to assume you&rsquo;re not the only one who just can&rsquo;t get rid of the GTA V monkey off your back.</p>
<p>But, can the game get even better? The one-word answer to that question &mdash; <a href="https://rage.mp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://rage.mp/">RageMP</a>. RageMP is a modification of the original game keeping all the core functionalities intact but with some key features included. <strong>RageMP is a role-playing mod</strong> and allows you to play the game in multiplayer mode on a customized dedicated game server. If you love GTA 5 role-playing, you&rsquo;ll love Rage MP, GT-MP and RageMP.</p>
<h3>Gameplay</h3>
<p>The gameplay of RageMP is identical to the popular open-world game &ldquo;Grand Theft Auto V&rdquo; that it has branched out from. It is an open-world action-adventure game that takes place in a virtual game city loosely based on Los Angeles called Los Santos. The game also lets you roam around the open countryside of San Andreas.</p>
<p>The game can be played either from a first-person or a third-person&rsquo;s perspective. The objective of the game is to complete some specific missions to advance through the story. The player is free to roam around the open world using any means of available transportation or simply by walking/running as well. Players also face combat missions, in which case they can use explosives, firearms or simple melee attack skills.</p>
<p>The single-player mode revolves around three criminal individuals Trevor, Michael and Franklin. You can switch between the three characters while playing or the game switches the roles automatically for specific missions.</p>
<p>Every player has a set of eight distinct skills <em>(fighting, diving, flying skills, etc.)</em>. As the game progresses, you can level up the skills to make them more effective as the mission objective gets more intense and difficult.</p>
<h3>Multiplayer</h3>
<p>Multiplayer mode <em>(RageMP)</em> opens up a lot of game features that are otherwise not provided or restricted in the single mod gameplay. The multiplayer mode allows you to play with up to 30 players simultaneously. <strong>It&rsquo;s also the best-known GTA V mod for role-playing</strong>. The open-world design still allows you to roam around the city freely. Players enter lobbies to engage in completing some specific tasks, either individually or cooperatively (teams). This mod also lets the players manipulate certain parameters to create custom jobs like deathmatch weapon re-spawn timing or racetracks.</p>
<p>Players can create their teams or crew with a maximum member of 5 players to complete the missions cooperatively. On completion of tasks, the crew members earn experience points and climb up the ranking system. Earning experience points also allow you to unlock additional features such as new weapons, car customizations, clothes, or even advanced activities such as aircraft and parachute.</p>
<p><strong>The multiplayer mode revolves around three main game components:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Deathmatch (free-for-all or team matchups)</li>
<li>Racing (bike, boat, air, or car) and</li>
<li>Objective-based missions (single-player or cooperative)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Modifications</h3>
<p>RageMP also comes with some astounding in-game customization options that are either unavailable or limited in the actual game. The modification in specific enhances your multiplayer game experience to a whole new level. You can customize the multiplayer settings to any configuration depending on your game requirements allowing you to unlock the optimum RageMP gameplay experience without any limitations.</p>
<h3>How to Install Add-Ons on A RageMP&nbsp;Server</h3>
<p><strong>Installing Mods on a RageMP server</strong> is quite a challenge for new server hosts. The lack of proper information and guides also does not help. The fact that there is no official script extender for the RageMP server makes it a bit more complicated than it should be. But that does not mean one cannot modify the RageMP server.</p>
<p>The thing is, on RageMP server, things work differently. Unlike other mods in other game servers, merely downloading and copying the contents does not fix and install the Scripts.</p>
<p>Read the step by step how to install custom scripts, mods, and add-ons on a RageMP Server below.</p>
<br>
<h3>How to install Custom&nbsp;Scripts:</h3>
<h4>Downloading the&nbsp;Script</h4>
<p>There are many custom scripts players can add onto the RageMP server. <strong>These scripts can easily be installed</strong>, and all of them are free to download. It is simple: choose a custom script, download it. It is crucial to select the latest version of the Script to avoid bugs and glitches.</p>
<h4>Moving the&nbsp;Script:</h4>
<p>The Script must be moved into the scripts folder in the <em>RageMP Server&gt; CFXServerDattaMaster&gt; Resources</em>. Move the folder found in the downloaded file into the resources folder. The contents of the folder do not need any edits, but it has to be included in the start load Command prompt.</p>
<h4>Configuring and Running the&nbsp;Script:</h4>
<p>The last step is to set the Script. The task is to <strong>open the server.cfg</strong> with Notepad or Notepad++. The Scripts can be found in the text group that has &ldquo;start&rdquo; labeled. To configure the custom script, it must be added there. Add a new line and type <em>&ldquo;Start &lt;script name&gt;,&rdquo;</em> save the file and close.</p>
<p>Once done, load the server. The Script should be automatically loaded in the prompt screen with the others. The Custom script should work like any other scripts with the commands.</p>
<h3>How to Install&nbsp;Mods:</h3>

<h3>How to install Custom&nbsp;Scripts:</h3>
<br>

<h4>Downloading the&nbsp;Script</h4>
<p>There are many custom scripts players can add onto the RageMP server. <strong>These scripts can easily be installed</strong>, and all of them are free to download. It is simple: choose a custom script, download it. It is crucial to select the latest version of the Script to avoid bugs and glitches.</p>
<h4>Moving the Script:Error] Failed to load module &ldquo;node-module&rdquo;, could not find (lib)node-module.so</h4>
<p>The Script must be moved into the scripts folder in the <em>RageMP Server&gt; CFXServerDattaMaster&gt; Resources</em>. Move the folder found in the downloaded file into the resources folder. The contents of the folder do not need any edits, but it has to be included in the start load Command prompt.</p>
<h4>Configuring and Running the&nbsp;Script:</h4>
<p>The last step is to set the Script. The task is to <strong>open the server.cfg</strong> with Notepad or Notepad++. The Scripts can be found in the text group that has &ldquo;start&rdquo; labeled.

<p>Once done, load the server. The Script should be automatically loaded in the prompt screen with the others. The Custom script should work like any other scripts with the commands.</p>
<h3>How to Install&nbsp;Mods:</h3>
<p><strong>Installing mods is quite similar to installing scripts</strong>. Unlike other games, however, RageMP server relies heavily on Mods and extensions. Like installing scripts, one will need the mod files to put into the server. All mods, texts, and add-ons are installed using the resources folder. The method is simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find and download the mods required to be installed into the RageMP folder.</li>
<li>Add the folders and files into the Resources folder of RageMP Servers. It is essential to look at the names of the mods being installed. The mods should contain&nbsp;.iua resource files.</li>
<li>Using the Control panel, the next step is to open and edit the file called citmp<em>-server.yml</em>. There should be a line termed <em>&ldquo;AutoStartResources.&rdquo;</em> This is the list of the activated mods and plugins of the game. The lines already included are essential mods and plugins, so those are not to be altered.</li>
<li>To add the new downloaded mods, using the same format as the other lines, simply add the name of the mods <em>(The mod will also provide the required steps and instructions in the form of a text file or in the descriptions. The guidelines will give the name needed to be added to the Script)</em>.</li>
<li>The last step is to <strong>restart the server</strong>. Shut down Grand Theft Auto 5 and the server and start it again, and the mod should be working.</li>
</ol>
<h4>How to Install Mods that require MySQL&nbsp;Database</h4>
<p>Some Mods need MYSQL database for them to be installed and functioning correctly. Installing mods with My SQL is simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>Of course, the first step will be to download and install MySQL for RageMP. The<a href="https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html"> Community Edition</a> is most commonly used for the RageMP servers</li>
<li>During the Installation, the Modder will be emailed the MySQL Details. The subject will be called &ldquo;Database Information.&rdquo; Four details will be required to be entered into the Mod: Database name, hostname, username, and password.</li>
<li>The next step is to locate the mod folder (this should be found in&hellip;/resources/&hellip;). This can be done using FTP or the Control panel.</li>
<li>In the Server. Lua file, there will be a line, including the password, username, and database where the information will be entered. Check the documentation of the mod. Some mods also use a config.lua for entering the details.</li>
<li>Some mods require SQL to be run. It is a script which will set up the necessary database tables for the mod. This&nbsp;.sql file can be found in the mod folder, or are available for download on the download page.</li>
<li>Using the MySQL details, log into PHPMyAdmin using the MySQL details. The link will also be included in the Database Information email.</li>
<li>Finally, select the database on the left. In the&nbsp;.sql file, the contents should be copied in the text area. Click &ldquo;go&rdquo; on the right side of the page at the bottom.</li>
<li>Finally, restart the server, and it should be working.</li>
