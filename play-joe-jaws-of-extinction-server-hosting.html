                  </div>
                  </div>
                  <div class="info-content">
                    <p><br /><br /><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/617850/extras/Store_-_Perspective.gif?t=1610581616" class="img-fluid" alt="Joe Server hosting"/><br /><br />Play single player, co-op with up to 4 friends or multiplayer (population planned for up to 50 players). Follow the storyline and uncover the dark secrets of Eden-Nadir or go off the beaten track and simply survive in the huge, open-world, hand-crafted environment.<br /><br /><br /><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/617850/extras/Store_-_Infected.gif?t=1610581616" class="img-fluid" alt="Joe Server hosting" /></p>
<h2>A CAPABLE THREAT</h2>
<p>The infected can do almost everything you can do&mdash;climb, vault, run, and even open doors. To get an edge, players must use stealth, cunning and the appropriate equipment to survive.<br /><br /><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/617850/extras/Store_-_Combat.gif?t=1610581616" class="img-fluid" alt="Joe Server hosting"/></p>
<h2>CLASSIC DESIGN, NEW HORROR</h2>
<p>The infected are not reanimated undead. They are conscious and completely aware of what is happening, but have no control over their actions. Screaming in pain, they are slaves to the fungal parasite seen protruding from wounds on their bodies.<br /><br /><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/617850/extras/Store_-_Stealth.gif?t=1610581616" class="img-fluid" alt="Joe Server hosting"/></p>
<h2>HEADSHOTS? ROOKIE MISTAKE!</h2>
<p>Headshots will spread a cloud of hazardous fungal spores. The best way to eliminate the infected is by damaging the heart. Take mercy on them.<br /><br /><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/617850/extras/Store_-_Environment.gif?t=1610581616" class="img-fluid" alt="Joe Server hosting" /></p>
<h2>FEAR THE RAIN</h2>
<p>Infected are attracted to water and become extremely dangerous when exposed to it. Every trip to a reliable watering hole carries risk, and be wary of straying too far from safety when dark clouds are overhead. The skies will betray you in other ways too. Beware of flocks of carrion birds that will give away your position.<br /><br /><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/617850/extras/Store_-_Hunt.gif?t=1610581616" class="img-fluid" alt="Joe Server hosting"/></p>
<h2>IMMERSE YOURSELF!</h2>
<p>What will be your profession? You can build, craft, trade, farm, hunt, fight, scavenge, loot, ambush and steal&hellip; it&rsquo;s up to you! How will you choose to survive?<br /><br /><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/617850/extras/Store_-_DayWeather.gif?t=1610581616" class="img-fluid" alt="Joe Server hosting"/></p>
<h2>EXPLORE AND CLAIM VAST LANDSCAPES</h2>
<p>The island of Eden-Nadir&rsquo;s diverse biomes range from sweeping lavender and corn fields to sun-dappled forests and beautiful seashores which feed into murky swamps. If your looking to settle a more urban environment, then the island is dotted with deserted towns, fortified cities, even quaint villages and picturesque countryside retreats. All waiting to be claimed.</p>
<h2>PLANNED DURING ALPHA STAGE</h2>

<li>Single Player mode: Play on your own</li>
<li>Cooperative mode: Play with up to 4 friends</li>

                <h2>How much RAM do I need for my  Jaws Of Extinction Hosting Server?</h2>
                <p>First you need to know  Jaws Of Extinction utilizes two CPU threads. One is the main game thread and the other is the networking thread. A thread can use about 100% CPU. We advise people start out with the 100% CPU Deal..</p>

            <div>
            <h3>Main Game Thread</h3><br>
            <p> This thread does most of the core stuff in the game, including handling all the addons. This will normally be working the hardest of the two. It's common for this thread to be sitting at around ~60% CPU on busy servers.</p>

            <h3>Networking Thread</h3><br>
            <p>The networking thread normally uses up about ~15% on a busy server, but if you leverage it correctly it will work pretty hard. To really take advantage of this thread you need a map properly setup with area portals (PVS).</p>

                              <p>In Jaws Of Extinction 2, two teams compete for a combat-based objective. In the game's storyline, the teams are composed of mercenaries hired by two feuding brothers to protect the company assets belonging to one brother while trying to destroy those of the other; the teams are thus represented by the names of these companies: Reliable Excavation & Demolition (RED) and Builders League United (BLU). Players can choose to play as one of nine character classes in these teams, each with his own unique strengths, weaknesses, and weapons. In order to accomplish objectives efficiently, a balance of these classes is required due to how these strengths and weaknesses interact with each other in a team-based environment. Although the abilities of a number of classes have changed from earlier Jaws Of Extinction incarnations, the basic elements of each class have remained, that being one primary weapon, one secondary weapon, and one melee weapon. The game was released with six official maps, although over 100 maps have since been included in subsequent updates, including competitive remakes of older maps and community-assembled maps. When players choose a gamemode for the first time, an introductory video shows how to complete its objectives. During matches, the "Administrator",[13] a woman voiced by Ellen McLain, announces various game events over loudspeakers.The player limit is 16 on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. On the PC, in 2008 Valve updated the game to include a server variable that allows up to 32 players.</p>

                              <p>Below are some of the factors to consider before renting a  Jaws Of Extinction server host.</p>

                              <!-- /wp:heading -->

                              <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                              <p>This the sole point of getting a  Jaws Of Extinction server in the first place. Jaws Of Extinction can be hard and frustrating! Or what else do you expect it's a post-apocalyptic survival game.  Therefore if you are a new Jaws Of Extinction player you have to play the single-player and get the hang of it first before considering the multiplayer mode and renting a server. You get the hang of how to build a decent base, explore the map, and pick up some survival, crafting, and hunting strategies. </p>

                              <p>you'd need to figure out the best tricks to use in order to survive. So that in case you playing with friends you won't be the laughing stock all the time.</p>

                              <p>But once youâve survived your first few challenges and youâve got some good building ideas, multiplayer makes Jaws Of Extinction a lot more fun! So playing on a public server means you have no control of your stuff when you are offline. people can delete trash or even stealing your lot. so this factors in the need for renting a private  Jaws Of Extinction server which you can share with friends and monitor who has access to what by setting rules and permissions.</p>

                              <p>Not all game servers support mods! If you donât want to restrict your server to Vanilla  Jaws Of Extinction in the future, or you know you want to create a modded  Jaws Of Extinction server, then you need to check that your potential server host supports mod installation.&nbsp;</p>

                              <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                              <p>Some server control panels offer a one-click mod install system. If youâre sure you want the freedom of adding mods then this is the easiest option. You will be able to install addons from their built-in mod manager or take advantage of the range of mods available through the Steam Workshop. This generally means less messing around with the control panel and more game time. Some game server hosts support mods but you need to use FTP to install the mods yourself. Other companies offer a drop-down menu with a limited number of the most popular mods, like Starvation, Darkness Falls, and War of the Walkers. The ability to add mods sometimes comes at an extra cost.</p>

                              <p>This is an important factor when it comes to choosing your game server control panel.

At xgamingserver, all our servers are DDOS protected so you don't have to worry about that.</p>
