<p>Amidst the chaos of a disastrous mass containment failure at the supposed &ldquo;master site&rdquo; Site-02, you fight your way to the top alongside &mdash; and against &mdash; other players. From devious D-Class and cunning scientists to elite Mobile Task Force units (MTF), rebellious Chaos Insurgency (CI), and even the horrific SCP Entities, there are many key roles to play in this gruesome affair, so...&nbsp;<strong><em>How will you act amidst a containment breach?</em></strong><br /><br /><em>SCP: Secret Laboratory (SCP: SL)</em>&nbsp;is a free-to-play multiplayer horror game heavily based on the SCP Foundation series and its expanded universe of monsters and paranormal phenomena. The primary objective of the SCP Foundation (also &ldquo;the Foundation&rdquo;) is to safeguard the world from any and all entities, objects, or phenomena that are deemed potential threats to humanity, and thus to uphold the normalcy of the modern world. Recently, however, Chaos Insurgency forces have begun acting against the Foundation in pursuit of a future where humanity reigns supreme.<br /><br />The question is:&nbsp;<strong><em>What role will you play?</em></strong><br /><br /></p>
<ul class="bb_ul">
<li><strong>D-Class Personnel &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;Inmates kept within the bowels of the Foundation sites as lab rats; test subjects at the mercy of the Foundation&rsquo;s cruel practices. Escape from your confines and rebel against your imprisoners &mdash; by any means necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Foundation Scientists &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;Researchers, engineers, and division specialists; you must ensure your own survival until an MTF extracts you from the ensuing pandemonium. Use your wit &mdash; and access cards &mdash; to survive. But be wary of the Class-D scurrying beneath you; they&rsquo;ll do anything to escape their confines.</li>
<li><strong>Nine-Tailed Fox Units &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;The first MTF units to respond to the emergency. Your mission: To extract valuable Foundation personnel and to, with the utmost vehemence, terminate or re-contain any SCPs that have escaped.</li>
<li><strong>Foundation Security &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;On-site security personnel charged with restoring order amidst the chaos. Evacuate Scientists, terminate D-Class Personnel, re-contain escaped SCPs, and above all do whatever it takes to restore normalcy to your site.</li>
<li><strong>Chaos Insurgency &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;Once a mere splinter cell force and now a formidable military power, yet still but a shadow of their former Foundation employers. Your primary objective is to purge the facility of Foundation personnel and seize the &ldquo;assets&rdquo; that are deemed to serve the best interests of Delta Command, your elusive overseers.</li>
<li><strong>SCP Entities &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;Typically hostile sentient beings of an anomalous nature, all of which are extremely different from one another. You are to consider yourself an enemy of all humans, and formidable ones at that. Do not accept any attempts to compromise &mdash; you are naught but death.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />With each match comes new experiences, thrills, and threats. You will battle for survival with every faction: SCP Entities rampaging on their path to escape, Chaos Insurgency sabotaging the Foundation, MTF and Security mobilizing to secure the facility, and armed Scientists and D-Class who refuse to take &ldquo;no&rdquo; for an answer. Be prepared for anything.<br /><br />Rest assured, you will encounter many threats. Friends and foes alike will take up arms against you &mdash; you may be disintegrated by a tesla gate, or perhaps a hydrogen bomb lying right beneath your feet will begin its countdown to detonation.&nbsp;<strong><em>There are many ways to die, yet in turn, many ways to survive such a hell.</em></strong><br />SCP: SL features a growing roster of SCPs that includes the following:<br /><br /></p>
<ul class="bb_ul">
<li><strong>Playable SCPs</strong><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
<li><strong>SCP-049 &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;An archaic plague doctor with the sole intent of &ldquo;curing&rdquo; those ridden with the &ldquo;pestilence&rdquo;. Contact means death, but only momentarily; you may find that one of the side effects of the good doctor&rsquo;s surgery is being denied such an easy end.</li>
<li><strong>SCP-079 &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;A sentient A.I. that has access to most of the facility's hardware and monitoring systems. With the facility under its control, beware the doors you lock tight for safety becoming the reason for your demise. And always remember: You never know who could be watching.</li>
<li><strong>SCP-096 &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;An extremely slender, frail-looking humanoid. It hides its face for a reason. Simply peering at it will induce a state of unstoppable rage, in which it massacres anything around with its immense strength. Running is futile. Don't even peek.</li>
<li><strong>SCP-106 &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;A humanoid composed of an anomalous jet-black substance. Contact means certain death, or supposedly an equivalent of such. Presume you&rsquo;re never safe whilst 106 looms.</li>
<li><strong>SCP-173 &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;A mere concrete sculpture, upon first glance. On second glance, you&rsquo;ll notice it&rsquo;s somehow closer. There is no third glance &mdash; you're dead by then.</li>
<li><strong>SCP-939 &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;A pack-dependent predator that intelligently mimics human voices to deceive and entrap its desired prey. Remember who your allies are. Be wary of who you trust. Don't fall for stray imitations, lest you&rsquo;re repaid with a bite.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Object SCPs</strong><br />
<ul class="bb_ul">
<li><strong>SCP-018 &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;A red 1969 Wham-O Super Ball that doubles its velocity with each rebound. Only aim towards targets authorized for immediate termination.</li>
<li><strong>SCP-207 &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;A bottle of cola, the contents of which offer radically increased motor functioning, for the mere cost of a completely devastated metabolism. You must ask yourself the question: Is momentary salvation worth the torturous death sure to follow?</li>
<li><strong>SCP-268 &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;A tweed newsboy cap that makes the wearer invisible to the naked eye. Don to avoid death or make a daring escape &mdash; the possibilities are endless, so long as you don&rsquo;t draw unwanted attention.</li>
<li><strong>SCP-500 &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;A single red pill capable of instantaneously curing any affliction. Such a wonder drug is irreplaceable &mdash; think carefully before use.</li>
<li><strong>SCP-914 &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;An anomalous machine that is capable of improving or degrading whatever contents are placed within &mdash; all at the whim of its user.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Site-02 is an unforgiving place. Stay on your toes, follow protocol, survive or die for the cause, and remember&hellip;</p>
<h2 class="bb_tag">We die in the dark so others may live in the light.</h2>

                <p>First you need to know  SCP-Secret Laboratory utilizes two CPU threads. One is the main game thread and the other is the networking thread. A thread can use about 100% CPU. We advise people start out with the 100% CPU Deal..</p>

            <h3>Main Game Thread</h3><br>
            <p> This thread does most of the core stuff in the game, including handling all the addons. This will normally be working the hardest of the two. It's common for this thread to be sitting at around ~60% CPU on busy servers.</p>

            <h3>Networking Thread</h3><br>
            <p>The networking thread normally uses up about ~15% on a busy server, but if you leverage it correctly it will work pretty hard. To really take advantage of this thread you need a map properly setup with area portals (PVS).</p>

                              <p>In SCP-Secret Laboratory, two teams compete for a combat-based objective. In the game's storyline, the teams are composed of mercenaries hired by two feuding brothers to protect the company assets belonging to one brother while trying to destroy those of the other; the teams are thus represented by the names of these companies: Reliable Excavation & Demolition (RED) and Builders League United (BLU). Players can choose to play as one of nine character classes in these teams, each with his own unique strengths, weaknesses, and weapons. In order to accomplish objectives efficiently, a balance of these classes is required due to how these strengths and weaknesses interact with each other in a team-based environment. Although the abilities of a number of classes have changed from earlier Team Fortress incarnations, the basic elements of each class have remained, that being one primary weapon, one secondary weapon, and one melee weapon. The game was released with six official maps, although over 100 maps have since been included in subsequent updates, including competitive remakes of older maps and community-assembled maps. When players choose a gamemode for the first time, an introductory video shows how to complete its objectives. During matches, the "Administrator",[13] a woman voiced by Ellen McLain, announces various game events over loudspeakers.The player limit is 16 on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. On the PC, in 2008 Valve updated the game to include a server variable that allows up to 32 players.</p>

                              <p>Below are some of the factors to consider before renting a  SCP-Secret Laboratory server host.</p>

                              <h2> SCP-Secret Laboratory is a Multiplayer Game</h2>
                              <!-- /wp:heading -->

                              <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                              <p>This the sole point of getting a  SCP-Secret Laboratory server in the first place. SCP-Secret Laboratory can be hard and frustrating! Or what else do you expect it's a post-apocalyptic survival game.  Therefore if you are a new SCP-Secret Laboratory player you have to play the single-player and get the hang of it first before considering the multiplayer mode and renting a server. You get the hang of how to build a decent base, explore the map, and pick up some survival, crafting, and hunting strategies. </p>

                              <p>you'd need to figure out the best tricks to use in order to survive. So that in case you playing with friends you won't be the laughing stock all the time.</p>

                              <p>But once youâve survived your first few challenges and youâve got some good building ideas, multiplayer makes SCP-Secret Laboratory a lot more fun! So playing on a public server means you have no control of your stuff when you are offline. people can delete trash or even stealing your lot. so this factors in the need for renting a private  SCP-Secret Laboratory server which you can share with friends and monitor who has access to what by setting rules and permissions.</p>

                              <p>Not all game servers support mods! If you donât want to restrict your server to Vanilla  SCP-Secret Laboratory in the future, or you know you want to create a modded  SCP-Secret Laboratory server, then you need to check that your potential server host supports mod installation.&nbsp;</p>
                              <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                              <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                              <p>Some server control panels offer a one-click mod install system. If youâre sure you want the freedom of adding mods then this is the easiest option. You will be able to install addons from their built-in mod manager or take advantage of the range of mods available through the Steam Workshop. This generally means less messing around with the control panel and more game time. Some game server hosts support mods but you need to use FTP to install the mods yourself. Other companies offer a drop-down menu with a limited number of the most popular mods, like Starvation, Darkness Falls, and War of the Walkers. The ability to add mods sometimes comes at an extra cost.</p>

The ping time is a very important indicator for online games. Therefore the location of the gaming servers plays a critical role in the fluidity of your gameplay.

                              <p> SCP-Secret Laboratory&nbsp;servers can run on consoles, PC, and Linux. &nbsp;At the moment console server gaming for SCP-Secret Laboratory is limited so for the best experience we advise using PC gaming.  Which supports both multiplayer: Survival (both randomly generated and standard) and Creative modes.</p>

                              <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                              <p>This is an important factor when it comes to choosing your game server control panel. Most gaming server companies use the TCadmin or multicraft panels which are not customized. At Xgamingserver we've based our SCP-Secret Laboratory game control panel on the Pterodactyl panel.</p>
                              <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                              <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                              <p>Which the developers prioritize security, and the control panel includes password hashing, two-factor authentication, and HTTPS as standard. One of the most interesting design and security decisions made by the developers is Docker support. All game servers run in Docker containers, providing excellent control over resources, improved security, and environments tailored to the needs of each game.</p>

                              <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                              <p>The online gaming and e-sports sector is one of the main targets of DDoS attacks. As a result, it is essential for hosting platforms to be permanently protected against these frequent, massive threats. So when choosing your game hosting provider for SCP-Secret Laboratory, It is important to ensure that their servers are protected for DDos attacks. At xgamingserver, all our servers are DDOS protected so you don't have to worry about that.</p>

                              <p>Price is an important factor when selecting a game server. Expensive servers do not necessarily mean good performance. At<a href="https://xgamingserver.com/"> Xgamingserver</a> we sell game servers according to dedicated resources. You pay what you get.</p>

                              <p>Good customer support is essential when choosing a host for your  SCP-Secret Laboratory server. At some point, you're guaranteed to need to contact them with an issue of some kind. Before you sign up with them, it helps to know how responsive they are to customer inquiries. Check their website for contact options to make sure there is a contact method that suits you. In addition to the usual ticket system, do they offer chat services or email support? Maybe they have a Discord server you can join? You could even try contacting them to ask a few questions and judge their professionalism and response time before signing up.</p>

                              <p>If youâre new to game server hosting, or you're not sure your potential host offers the services you need, it might be worthwhile asking them if they'll create a test server for you to trial. Hosts won't always advertise the possibility of a trial, but if you contact them you might be surprised by their willingness to provide a test service. If a trial isn't possible, you need to be clear on their refund policy (often called âmoney back guaranteeâ). </p>
