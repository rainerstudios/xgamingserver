                  <h1>XGamingSever Terms of Service</h1>
                  <p>
                  The scope of our services is based on the service description in force at the time of placing the order.
</p>
<p>
The cost of a subscription to one of our services will remain the same during the entire duration of the rental, subject to consumer price index increase or decreases and in some cases VAT.
</p>
<p>
All services offered by us assume a minimum service period of one month with an automatic extension of the agreement for one month periods if you opted for automatic renewal.
</p>
<p>
All services sold on this website are automatically delivered, within 15 minutes after you make your payment.
</p>
<p>
Setup is typically completed instantly after payment by our automatic order system, if this is not the case make sure to wait for a little while. If it takes more than two hours please reach out to us by opening a ticket.
</p>
<p>
We try to provide you with the best uptime we possibly can, and in normal situations this means that your server will be online 24-7. If there is an outage due to unforeseen circumstances we may choose to credit your account. If this is the case, make sure to open a ticket and we'll review your case.
</p>
<h2>Customer Support</h2>
<p>
Our customer support generally respond within 12 hours to assist you with all of your gameserver problems.
During peak times it may take a little longer than usual to receive a reply.
</p>
<p>
We expect our staff to be treated with respect, as they will treat you with respect. Let's all be kind to each other. If you are abusive towards our staff we reserve the right to suspend your service or refuse to communicate with you.
Our staff will do their upmost best to resolve any problem you have as long as it's within the support guidelines, and sometimes even more.
</p>
<h2>Payment</h2>
<p>
Payment for the services is to be made before we deliver them. Typically we bill in one month cycles, but alternatives may be chosen upon order checkout.
If you have signed up to auto-renew within our payment gateway, we will automatically bill your card every month to avoid any suspensions.
For payments made with PayPal, we will auto-renew your subscription until you let us know you'd like to cancel. If you'd like to switch to manual renewal, please inform us.
To cancel, please use the cancel option on the clientarea stating the reason for cancelation. The payment method used will be charged 5 days before the invoice due date.
After your billing cycle is over and you haven't sent in a payment to renew we will typically wait about 48 Hours before our system will suspend your gameserver.
After it has been suspended you have another 5 days to re-activate before we permanently delete your files from our systems.
If you cancel your subscription service, you will not be billed anymore, your service however, will remain online until the end of the payment cycle.

</p>
<h2>Hardware</h2>
<p>
We use the best of the best hardware, our servers are very well equiped for your gaming needs. However as with all electronic devices sometimes a failure can occur. Our systems automatically take off-site backups every 24H of your gameserver to ensure we'll always be able to restore your service.
In the event of a gameserver having a hardware failure, we'll restore service as soon as the machine is repaired.
</p>
<p>
However, the ultimate responsibility for backups of data lies with you, not Xgamingserver.
</p>
<p>
Backups are provided on a best-effort basis, we cannot be held responsible if we don't have a backup for your gameserver. If you'd like to make sure you have your files at all times, make sure to take a local backup via FTP.
</p>
<h2>Legal</h2>
<p>
You warrant that all information you have given to us is correct and complete.
</p>
<p>
If you're younger than 13, make sure you have the permission of your parents to make a purchase with Xgamingserver. If you make a purchase and later on it gets disputed for no valid reason, we'll permanently remove your gameserver.
</p>
<p>
You expressly assures us that the provision and publication of content created either by yourself or any third party neither infringes Cayman law nor any other law applicable in your country of residence, in particular copyright, data protection and competition law. We reserve the right to remove any content from your gameserver that appear to be of dubious content. We shall immediately inform you about any intended deletion of content. The same shall apply if we are requested by third parties to change or delete content because of a violation of third party rights.
</p>
<p>
If our services and servers are used to conduct unlawful/illegal activities we will suspend our services to you immediately and no refund of payments will be provided. We also reserve the right to take legal actions against you.
</p>
<p>
We shall be liable for any damages caused by us only in case of gross negligence or intent. Otherwise, liability is excluded. We shall not be liable for any (business) damages incurred by you caused by any technical failure or downtime of your gameserver. Of course, we will do everything to limit technical failures and downtime as much as possible.
</p>
<p>
You indemnify us against all possible third party claims arising from any unlawful/illegal action by you or from errors in the information provided by you to us. This applies in particular to copyright, data protection and competition law violations.
</p>
<h2>Refunds/Returns</h2>
<p>
  1. The customer is entitled to a refund if the services of XGamingSever have an availability of less than 99%<br>
  2. The customer is entitled to a refund if the services of XGamingSever are having technical issues for a long period of time.<br>

  5. A refund will be processed within 7 business days.<br>
  6. While you may opt out of future billings at any time during your subscription, no portion of the subscription is refundable per our customer agreement.<br>
  7. The customer may not refund the payment, through payment services such as paypal by submitting a claim. They must always request a refund via the XGamingSever support.<br>
