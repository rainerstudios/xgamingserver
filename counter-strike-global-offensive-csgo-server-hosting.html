                  <p><br />For those of you not totally familiar with CSGO, or even online gaming, you may be unaware of the concept of tick rate. In simple terms, a tick is when a server completes an instruction set. This can be collecting and calculating different events caused by players or physics objects, how they&rsquo;ll cause other parts of the game to react, and then send those calculations back to the players. Every time a server performs that set, it has undergone one tick.</p>
                  <p>A server&rsquo;s tick rate is measured in Hertz (Hz), however, most mentions usually just use the number. This means that for each second, a server undergoes a certain amount of ticks. So on a 64-tick server, each second of time the server goes through that entire instruction set 64 times. The more ticks per second each server, the more instruction sets it can go through, providing more accurate physics, movement and hit registration during games.</p>
                  <p>It&rsquo;s not only servers that are rated through tick rates. The player&rsquo;s own PC has a tick rate as well, referred to as a &ldquo;client-side tick rate.&rdquo; This is set by the user, and effectively does the opposite of what the server does, by sending out the data, calculations and input performed on the user&rsquo;s PC</p>
                  <h2>Main differences between CSGO tick rates</h2>
                  <p><br />For the purposes of this article, we&rsquo;ll focus on the differences between the two main values used in CSGO, 64 and 128 tick. On the official matchmaking servers hosted by Valve, the servers are exclusively operated on a 64 Hz tick rate. If you compete in tournaments or Pick-Up Game (PUGs) on services like ESEA or FACEIT, then you'll be playing on 128 tick servers. Simply put, 128 tick servers offer double the processing time. With twice the processing time, the accuracy of your weapons will be higher meaning it&rsquo;s more likely that every bullet will count.</p>
                  <p>The most noticeable difference between the two server tick rates is when throwing grenades. There&rsquo;s multiple examples of grenade line-ups that require jumping or running, which don&rsquo;t work when you move up or down server tick rates. The reason why is that due to the doubled amount of processing time, the server logs the release at a different time meaning the trajectory will be different, so the grenade will land and activate at a different time.</p>
                  <p>However, the vast majority of people would probably be unable to tell the difference between different server tick rates. In a study performed on the main CSGO subreddit, it revealed that out of 760 unique participants (creating 1165 guesses) only 41.3% of people correctly guessed when they were on a 128-tick server. As with most things in CSGO, going up to 128 tick only appears to be more of a psychological difference than having any concrete effect for most players.</p>
                  <p>This feeling can be revealed in the decision making from other game developers. The only competitive FPS titles that account for servers up to 128 tick are CSGO and VALORANT, with most other big name titles offering much lower tick rate servers. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare runs its main multiplayer servers at either 12 or 22 tick, Overwatch currently runs at 60.25 tick.</p>
                  <h2>Other performance variables</h2>
                  <p><br />While it may sound fantastic to raise the tick rate on every server to as high as they can go, it isn&rsquo;t that simple. A number of other factors and variables all tie into game performance beyond whatever the tick rate of the server you&rsquo;re playing on is.</p>
                  <p>A huge, and very noticeable, variable of server performance is your latency to a server, more commonly referred to as ping. In LAN environments, where professional players tend to ply their trade the majority of the time, the latency to the server is as low as it possibly can be, thus allowing for the most accurate experience in gameplay.</p>
                  <p>Another more subtle variable is your monitor&rsquo;s refresh rate. While the player&rsquo;s PC and the server are communicating either 64 or 128 times per second, the player themselves may not be able to notice any difference. The most popular monitor refresh rates for competitive play are 60 Hz, 120 Hz and 144 Hz, and similarly to the same concept of servers, the higher the value the more times per second your monitor refreshes.</p>
                  <p>While the server tick rate and monitor refresh rates aren&rsquo;t directly connected, having the latter higher is still important to your gameplay. This is due to client side animations being smoother, limiting screen tearing and other lag effects, meaning on your end you&rsquo;d have a more accurate game experience.</p>

          How to install MetaMod on a CSGO server:
      </h3>
      <p id="block-7f32ae97-5da8-4d0e-a73d-85575beb7001" tabindex="0">
          MetaMod is an important mod plugin, and it is built with and for the
          half-life engine. Since it is a very dynamic tool, it allows the
          half-Life engine to run with mod addons and plugins. Initially, it is
          essential if a player wants to mod their Cs: Go server in any way.
          Follow the instructions to install the MetaMod on the CS: Go servers.
      </p>
      <ol id="block-6b75a7e0-f377-4e94-bb0a-1066b5274b77" tabindex="0">
          <li>
              Download MetaMod: The first step here would be to go ahead and
              download the latest versions of the MetaMod: Source. It is
              essential to update the Game and the servers before installing
              MetaMod to avoid errors during installations.
          </li>
          <li>
              Extract and store the Files: The files will be downloaded as a â
              zip file. Extract the data onto a folder and save it to the
              desktop. The file should contain an âaddonâ folder.
          </li>
          <li>
              Locate the server directory: The Server directory is the location
              where the addons will be stored. In the case of a private server,
              use an FTP client to run and open the server directory. Otherwise,
              simply go to the Server Directory from the Local discs. After that
              simply drag the folder into the main CSGO directory.
          </li>
          <li>
              The next step is simple: Generate a VDF file for CSGO using the
              Link http://www.sourcemm.net/?go=vdf. The method is rather simple.
              Just select Game and click on âgenerate metaMod.VDFâ option and the
              file should be downloaded automatically.
          </li>
          <li>
              Before proceeding, check the file. Run it with Word pad or Notepad
  and see if the text is correct:            <em>âPluginâ { âFileâ â../csgo/addons/metamod/bin/serverâ }</em>
          </li>
          <li>
              Move the mod into the addons folder. Once that is done, restart the
              server. Use the console to reconnect to again and enter the command
              for âmeta version.â There should be a reply prompt indicating that
              a valve Server Plugin is loaded.

          Now that the MetaMod has been taken care of, the CS: GO servers should
          be able to run the SourceMod. This will allow the server to be more
          versatile and install more mods and plugins. Of course, first, the
          player will need the SourceMod files.

          They are useful in several ways, starting from better accessibility and
          permissions. Furthermore, it provides a better user-friendly navigation
          menu for the server hosts. In any case, if the server host wants to
          install additional mods and plugins, then SourceMod becomes a mandatory
          download for any Counterstrike fans.

          </li>
          <li>
              The data will again be downloaded as a .zip file which would
              contain cfg and addon files. Simply extract the data.
          </li>
          <li>
              Use the FTP client to navigate into the server directory or

          <li>
              Finally, move the mid folder into the CSGO Server Directory. The
              Addons folder will now have three files. Metamod.vdf that was
              copied earlier, SourceMod and MetaMod sub-folders.
          </li>
          <li>
              Now we edit the .ini file of Metamod to be able to run Sourcemod.
              The data should be present in the Metamod folder, find the .ini
              file and open it with a text editor. Scroll down and add lines

          </li>
          <li>
              After that, simply restart the server and SourceMod should be
              running.

            <h3>Main Game Thread</h3><br>
            <p> This thread does most of the core stuff in the game, including handling all the addons. This will normally be working the hardest of the two. It's common for this thread to be sitting at around ~60% CPU on busy servers.</p>

            <h3>Networking Thread</h3><br>
            <p>The networking thread normally uses up about ~15% on a busy server, but if you leverage it correctly it will work pretty hard. To really take advantage of this thread you need a map properly setup with area portals (PVS).</p>

  <h2>&nbsp;</h2>
  </div>
  <h3><span data-preserver-spaces="true">What is a CSGO Server Login token?</span></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Gameserver Login Tokens (GSLTs) is a procedure that Steam has implemented as a security measure. In order to run gameservers of certain Steam Games ( eg CSGO) it is necessary to generate a token.</span></p>
<h3><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;What is the purpose of a CSGO login token?</span></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In the past, Valve made a few rule changes for hosting a game server. Not all game server operators have followed those regulations. As a consequence, the IP addresses of game servers were banned.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, this method was not effective, since it could easily be bypassed with a new IP address and was also a huge issue for game server providers. The reason for this is that by banning the IP address, other customers were often also affected.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">That&rsquo;s why this system has been implemented, which instead bans the token and blocks the linked Steam Account for further game server operation.</span></p>
<h3><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;Create CSGO token</span></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">To create a gameserver login token, you need to be logged in to the Steam website. The Token can be created here:&nbsp;</span><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/dev/managegameservers" target="_blank"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Steam Game Server Account Management</span></a></p>

                              <p>Combant games never go out of fashion. And CS GO is one of them. The game pits two teams against each other: Terrorists and Counter-Terrorists. Both sides are tasked with eliminating the other while completing separate objectives. The most common game modes involve the Terrorists planting a bomb while Counter-Terrorists attempt to stop them, or Counter-Terrorists attempting to rescue hostages that the Terrorists have captured. There are nine game modes, all of which have distinct characteristics specific to that mode. The game also has matchmaking support that allows players to play on dedicated Valve servers, in addition to community-hosted servers with custom maps and game modes. A battle-royale game-mode, "Danger Zone", was introduced in December 2018.</p>

                              <!-- wp:paragraph -->

                              <p>Below are some of the factors to consider before renting a Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) server host.</p>

                              <h2>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) is a Multiplayer Game</h2>
                              <!-- /wp:heading -->

                              <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                              <p>This the sole point of getting a Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) server in the first place. CSGO can be hard and frustrating! Or what else do you expect it's a post-apocalyptic survival game.  Therefore if you are a new CS GO player you have to play the single-player and get the hang of it first before considering the multiplayer mode and renting a server. You get the hang of how to build a decent base, explore the map, and pick up some survival, crafting, and hunting strategies. </p>
                              <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                              <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                              <p>you'd need to figure out the best tricks to use in order to survive. So that in case you playing with friends you won't be the laughing stock all the time.</p>

                              <p>But once youâve survived your first few challenges and youâve got some good building ideas, multiplayer makes CSGO a lot more fun! So playing on a public server means you have no control of your stuff when you are offline. people can delete trash or even stealing your lot. so this factors in the need for renting a private Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) server which you can share with friends and monitor who has access to what by setting rules and permissions.</p>

If you donât want to restrict your server to Vanilla Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) in the future, or you know you want to create a modded Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) server, then you need to check that your potential server host supports mod installation.&nbsp;</p>

                              <p>Some server control panels offer a one-click mod install system. If youâre sure you want the freedom of adding mods then this is the easiest option. You will be able to install addons from their built-in mod manager or take advantage of the range of mods available through the Steam Workshop. This generally means less messing around with the control panel and more game time. Some game server hosts support mods but you need to use FTP to install the mods yourself. Other companies offer a drop-down menu with a limited number of the most popular mods, like Starvation, Darkness Falls, and War of the Walkers. The ability to add mods sometimes comes at an extra cost.</p>

At some point, you're guaranteed to need to contact them with an issue of some kind. Before you sign up with them, it helps to know how responsive they are to customer inquiries. Check their website for contact options to make sure there is a contact method that suits you. In addition to the usual ticket system, do they offer chat services or email support? Maybe they have a Discord server you can join? You could even try contacting them to ask a few questions and judge their professionalism and response time before signing up.</p>

                              <p>If youâre new to game server hosting, or you're not sure your potential host offers the services you need, it might be worthwhile asking them if they'll create a test server for you to trial. Hosts won't always advertise the possibility of a trial, but if you contact them you might be surprised by their willingness to provide a test service. If a trial isn't possible, you need to be clear on their refund policy (often called âmoney back guaranteeâ). </p>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
</div>
<div >
  <h3>
      How Long before my CSGO server comes online?
  </h3>
  <p>
      Once you place an order and complete payment, CSGO server will be fired up
      and installed within minutes. You will then receive an email with our game
      panel login link and notifying you that your server is installed.
  </p>
  <p>
      So you'll just create a password to the panel and access your CSGO server.
  </p>
  <h3>
      What is the monthly cost of renting a server?
  </h3>
  <p>
      Our costs for CSGo servers are broken down as shown above from 15 to 35
      dollars. Want anything custom just reach out.
  </p>
  <h3>
      Will my server be always online?
  </h3>
  <p>
      We constantly monitor our servers our team will be ready to intervene if
      your server becomes unavailable.
  </p>
  <h3>
      How long do I have to rent a server?
  </h3>
  <p>
      Our CSGO servers are rented for monthly cycles but you are free to cancel
      anytime you feel. The longer you decide to rent a server, the cheaper it
      will be for you in the long run. If you play with your friends or in a
      team, you can save money by splitting the cost
  </p>
  <h3>
      Can I switch my server?
  </h3>
  <p>
      Bored with CSGO? No worries we can switch your server to any other game
      server that we host.
  </p>
  <h3>
      How many slots do my CSGO servers have?
  </h3>
  <p>
      As we mentioned we don't sell slots but dedicated server resources. want
      more slots than our default game slots just hit us up and will sort you
      out.
  </p>
  <h3>
      Can I install MetaMod &amp; SourceMod to my CSGO server?
  </h3>
  <p>
      sure you can install mods to your CSGO server. We'll be putting up a
      detailed guide on how you can install metamods and source mods on your
      servers.
  </p>
  <h3>
      Do I need more RAM/CPU for my CS:GO server?
  </h3>
  <p>
      This depends on whether you add a lot of extra resources, or if you want to
      play the game in basic mode. The prepaid game servers are perfectly
      configured, so thereâs no need of add-on specs. However, if you still want
      to do so, you are free to! As you checkout, you can choose to add extra
      RAM.
